In commerce, customer experience (CX) is the product of an interaction between an organization and a customer over the duration of their relationship.

Why did MatrixCX was created?

The issue with out of the box software depends on how well it is written? Right. The open source software needs customisation but writing software takes time. Extensibility eventually is eventually comporimised when businesses are strained by budgets and time and lack of in-house IT and Developer engineering teams. Business requirements grow and change like climate change. So either the software is out of date with the change in business and economy or business and maintainer of the software has to spend a lot of time and money to keep evolving the software. So MatrixCX is designed from ground up to solve that very issue - The Extensibility with Business Evolution.
